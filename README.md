# ECE539-project

For the ECE 539 Project, we use Artificial Neural Networks to diagnose COVID-19 patients based on computed tomography (CT) datasets. 
We use a new COVID-19 CT dataset from https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT to train our model. The dataset contains 349 COVID-19 CT images from 216 patients and 463 non-COVID-19 CTs. 

To run the code, open main.py and choose a model; then directly run main.py.
